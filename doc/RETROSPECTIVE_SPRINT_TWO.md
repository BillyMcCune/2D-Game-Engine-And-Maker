## Project's current progress

* We are slightly behind schedule since most members were very busy this past week
* We have a majority of the back-end completed
* Front-end is behind schedule and does not match the back-end progress
* Editor is nearly complete
* Must finish implementing editor saving

## Current level of communication

* Team meets frequently in person
* Team does not send many updates about what they're working on daily
* Need to add more Agile stand-up meetings

## Satisfaction with team roles

* Our team is working really well together and we all enjoy what were working on
* Going forward next week, we plan to transition roles so everyone gets a chance to touch different
  parts of the game

## Teamwork that worked well

* Thing #1:

    * We needed to do a TON of refactoring this sprint. I would say a large majority of the sprint
      focused on redesigning and implementing core features - which worked well because we all met
      up together consistently to agree upon what would be the best way.
* Thing #2

    * We met consistently and started doing more agile meetings over zoom so we could screen share (
      but in person)

## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing #1:

    * We need to make our issues board more clear and assign all issues to individuals
    * Sprint planning will make our communication and roles easier
* Thing #2:

    * We want to make steady progress each day, rather than making tons of commits on one day
    * It was tricky with the basketball schedule and members traveling, but this sprint we will make
      progress each day!

## Teamwork to improve next Sprint

* The issues board needs to be much clearer
* We need to communicate what were working on within our group chat
