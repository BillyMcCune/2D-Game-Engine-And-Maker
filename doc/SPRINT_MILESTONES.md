# OOGA Sprint Milestones

### It's Thyme to Eat: Salad

### Alana, Aksel, Tatum, Gage, Jacob, Billy, Luke

## Plan for Prioritization of Features

* Each team member has their assigned portion of the assignment and they are responsible for
  completing the features
* Each week, a new game will be developed, including the necessary elements for the game including
  both back-end objects, and front-end display elements.
* The back-end and front-end should work together to integrate features and prioritize integration
  over new feature development

## Project Timeline

#### Sprint 1

1. Dinosaur Jump - including rules, game interactions, and sprites
2. Basic Game Display, including buttons for playing and pausing
3. Game Loop
4. Game Objects and Classes initialized
5. Basic Movement and Physics Handlers 
6. Editor contains basic gridview and drop-downs for editing objects, but they do not necessarily do anything
7. Editor should be able to represent an object and all of its relevant properties
8. The Editor should be able to integrate at least one object to ensure that integration is smooth
9. NO CAMERA YET
10. Level files can be parsed, but cannot necessarily be saved

#### Sprint 2
1. Initialization of the Camera
2. Creation of rules and sprites for Geometry Dash
3. User can select which games to play from a drop-down of games
4. Games can have a goal
5. Level Files can be saved
6. Handle all Errors Appropriately
7. Splash Screens created
8. Front-End view of objects change during different interactions between objects 
9. The Editor Model can be converted to an XML file 
10. Predefined objects within editor

#### Sprint 3
1. Creation of rules and sprites for Super Mario Bros
2. Creation of rules and sprites for Doodle Jump
3. Users can progress between levels and levels get harder
4. Power-ups and more advanced features
5. Different player avatars
6. Sound Effects
7. Advanced Animations

#### Sprint 4
1. Help Documentation
