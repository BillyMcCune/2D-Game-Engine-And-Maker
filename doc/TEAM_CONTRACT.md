# OOGA Team Contract

### It's Thyme to Eat: Salad

### Alana, Aksel, Tatum, Gage, Jacob, Billy, Palo, Luke

## As a project team, we promise to:

* respect each other's ideas and work
* communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project
* others based on your team discussion

## Team Procedures

* when and how often to meet (at least once a week)
    * Using When2Meet to set up weekly meeting time
* preferred channel of communication (e.g., Zoom, e-mail, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)
    * Our team prefers to meet in-person if possible
    * We text in our group chat
    * If you cannot attend meeting in-person, next best bet is to attend via zoom, but this is meant
      for special circumstances (sickness, traveling) - prioritize coming to the meeting in-person
* preferred GIT workflow
    * Clone the Project Repository
    * Make your own branch
    * Make small commits to your branch
      * commits must follow consistent formatting conventions of:
        * ```
          [Type] [Requirement ID]: [Short summary - active present tense phrase] - [Issue Action]
          [Body - longer explanation of the changes, especially how they might impact your teeammates]
          Collaborators: [names of students who directly helped to design or develop this code]
          ```
    * Pull before you make changes
    * When merging your branch into main, don't break main!
        * All tests must work before you push to main
    * Tag each final commit of each sprint as "sprint-X" where X is the number sprint the team is on

### Meetings

* how to communicate action items made during the meeting
    * Each person goes around in a circle and says 3 things at the standup meeting:

    1. What did you do yesterday?
    2. What are you working on?
    3. Is there anything blocking you?

* policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to
  make up for it
    * Team member must give a valid reason for missing meeting
    * Team member must text in group chat and ask what they are responsible for working on and are
      responsible for asking any questions they may have
* policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting
    * Discuss and compromise with team

### Communications

* decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?)
    * Decisions will be made via consensus
* response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours)
    * Respond when you see text even if you don't know the answer - but no need to respond at
      unreasonable hour
* policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates
    * Text in group chat and any major design decisions, changes, and updates must be documented
      within our design doc

### Commitments

* what does it mean to work to the "best of your ability"
    * When we make an issue, and you are assigned to it, it is your responsibility to either complete
      it or communicate challenges
    * Don't over-promise features
    * If you are struggling to complete a feature - ask for help! Go to office hours or talk to team
* how to set internal deadlines
    * Use Agile framework to have a weekly deadlines for issues
* how to provide commitments others on the team can rely on
  * When a teammate is assigned a feature, they should complete it and build trust within the team
* policy for resolving failure to meet commitments
    * If a teammate is failing to meet commitments we will call a team meeting (could be over zoom)
  where all teammates talk together to resolve the issues.
    * If a teammate is not able to complete a feature within a sprint, they are either expected to
  complete it within the next sprint or give it to another teammate who is willing to take it on
  (this must be discussed with the teammate who's taking it on).

### Helping each other

* best ways to and when to ask for help
    * Ask early and ask in the group chat
    * Come to team meeting with a list of things you've already tried before asking for help
    * Go to Duvall's office hours to ask for extra help if needed
* responses to team member asking for help
    * Respond regardless if you know how to help or not and point them to a helpful resource
* how to support the team priorities
    * Be a team player and prioritize the features of the project that must be completed immediately
      rather than your own
* how to suggest design changes for specific pieces of code
    * Talk directly to the rest of the team and suggest your new idea
    * You must be able to support the new design choice with evidence and come prepared to answer
  any questions team may have about it

## If someone on our team breaks one or more of these agreements, the team may:

* have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement
* report the issue in the Team Sprint Report
* others based on your team discussion
