### Project Goals

We will focus on basic scrolling platformer games (no WiFi Dinosaur game, doodle jump, flappy bird, super mario bros, etc.)

### Project Emphasis

The emphasis of this project is on abstraction, where we as developers will focus on creating flexible, reusable components that simplify the complexity of both game creation and gameplay.

### Project Extensions

### Sprint Progress Goals

Good progress for weekly sprint goals would involve completing the highest-priority tasks that contribute directly to the productâ€™s core functionality, ensuring that the main features are working as intended. It would also include holding brief check-ins to align the team and ensuring the code is clean and ready for new functionality.
