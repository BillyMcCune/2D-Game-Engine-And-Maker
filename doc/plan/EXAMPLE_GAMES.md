## Example Game Descriptions
## OOGASALAD TEAM 3


## Game 1: Geometry Dash

The User should be able to create a recognizable version of geometry dash. The key game features include:
* automatic side-scrolling horizontal movement
* player-input that allows jumping
* landing on platforms
* hostile spikes that reset the level if collided with
* finite, fully-user created levels
* Power-ups that change player movement such as a rocket ship
* Progress achieved by reaching end of level

## Game 2: Doodle Jump
The User should be able to create a recognizable version of doodle jump. The key game features include:
* automatic vertical jumping that occurs on contact with a platform/enemy
* Infinitely-progressing upwards level with increasingly challenging difficulty
* player-input that allows shooting at enemies and moving horizontally
* unique platforms(spring, moving, fragile, disappearing, exploding)
* hostile, potentially moving enemies that reset the level if collided with
* Power-ups that change player movement such as a spring boots, rocket ship
* Score determined by how high the player reaches

## Functional Similarities
Both games are physics-based platformers that allow player input to affect movement. They both
involve avoiding collisions with obstacles/enemies and reaching power-ups that affect players movement.

## Functional differences
Doodle jump is fully vertical, while geometry dash is largely horizontal. Doodle jump input affects horizontal movement,
while geometry dash lets you jump. Geometry dash levels are fully user created while doodle jump requires configuring
and infinitely progression, procedurally generated level. Progression in doodle jumps requires tracking distance while
geometry dash involves reaching a location.
