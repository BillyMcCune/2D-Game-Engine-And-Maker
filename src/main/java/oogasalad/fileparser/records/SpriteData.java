/**
 * Represents a single sprite within a sprite sheet, including its name, position,
 * dimensions, base image, animation frames, and animation sequences.
 *
 * <p>This record is used by {@code SpriteSheetData} and is essential for both
 * rendering the sprite and supporting animations in the game engine or editor.
 *
 * <p>This record assumes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code name} uniquely identifies this sprite within the sheet.</li>
 *   <li>{@code x}, {@code y}, {@code width}, and {@code height} define the
 *       bounding box of the sprite within the overall image.</li>
 *   <li>{@code baseImage} defines the default appearance of the sprite (e.g., for use in the editor).</li>
 *   <li>{@code frames} contain named images that can be used in animations.</li>
 *   <li>{@code animations} define sequences of frames with timing information.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Used during sprite parsing, display setup, and editor visualization.
