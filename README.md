### Configuring OpenAI API Key

The chat assistant feature requires an OpenAI API key. You can configure it in one of the following ways (in order of precedence):

1. **Environment Variable**: Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

2. **Java System Property**: Pass the API key as a system property
   ```bash
   java -DOPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here -jar oogasalad.jar
   ```

3. **Config File**: Add your API key to `config.properties` in the resources directory
   ```properties
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

4. **Dot Env File**: Create a `.env` file in the project root
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

For security reasons, options #1 and #2 are recommended for production use.
